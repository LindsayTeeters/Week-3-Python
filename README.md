# Election_Analysis


## Overview of Election Audit

This project was to assist Seth and Tom with the election audit results. They had requested some further details for the election committee.
  1) The voter turnout for each county
  2) The percentage of votes from each county out of the total count
  3) The ccounty with the highest turnout

## Resources

*Data Sources:* Election Results ([election_result.csv](https://github.com/LindsayTeeters/Week-3-Python/blob/main/Resources/election_results.csv)) and  Starter Code ([PyPoll_Challenge_starter_code](https://github.com/LindsayTeeters/Week-3-Python/blob/main/Resources/PyPoll_Challenge_starter_code.py))
              
*Software:* Python 3.6.1, Visual Studio Code, 1.66.2

## Election-Audit Summary

For this challenge, we needed to make adjustments to the starter code in order for it to run properly. We added lines to the starter code to formulate calculations to find the winning candidate and votes by county. More data could be gathered during each election to provider a deeper analysis. This script could be modified by going down to another level. We could look at the votes by cities. This would help canidates in the furture to target their campaigns to particular cities.
